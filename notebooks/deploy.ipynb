    "- Change the kernel used in this notebook to the local project kernel with name \"[projectname] local\" (e.g. \"myImgClassUsingCNTK local\"). \n",
    "- All numbered scripts until `5_evaluate.py` have to be executed as is described in part 1 of the documentation. This trains the DNN/SVM model which will get deployed.\n",
    "- We assume the reader is familiar with the excellent deployment section of the [IRIS tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/tutorial-classifying-iris-part-3) and the [Model management setup how-to guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-configuration).\n",

    "- Init(): loads the trained DNN/SVM model into memory after the Rest API is deployed.\n",
    "- Run(): takes an image (in base64 encoding) as input, runs the full image classification pipeline including evaluating the DNN/SVM model, and returns the classification scores as json encoded string.\n",
    "- Main(): can be used locally to test and debug the init() and run() functions before deployment. It creates a random 5x5 pixel RGB image, converts it to a base64 encoded string, which is then used as input to the run() function.\n",

The working directory will likely look like this: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\azureml_runs\\imgClass-2017-12-07_1512663154758\n",
    "   ```sh \n",
    "   cd <WorkingDirectory>\n",

    "   ```sh\n",
    "   az ml env local\n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create Rest API service (this can take 10-20 minutes). Use the command below as-is if `classifier=svm` in `deploymain.py`, but if `classifier=dnn` then change *cntk_fixed.model* to *cntk_refined.model*.\n",

    "4. Test the Rest API directly from the command prompt:\n",

    "Note that this also outputs a *scoring url* which looks like (but is not identical) to *http://127.0.0.1:32773/score*. This url can be used in script `6_callWebservice.py` which shows how to call the REST API from python rather than the command line."

    "- Simply follow the all the instructions in the [model management setup how-to guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-configuration) to set up the cloud deployment environment. Be careful when creating an Azure Container Service to delete it again once not needed anymore.\n",
    "- Then run all steps except for step 2 as explained in the *local deployment* section. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "1. Register the environment provider:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   az provider register -n Microsoft.MachineLearningCompute\n",
    "   az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerRegistry \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create an ACS cluster (may take 10-20 minutes to be completely provisioned):\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   az ml env setup --cluster -l westcentralus -n acsdeployment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```sh\n",
    "    az ml env set -g acsdeploymentrg -n acsdeployment\n",
    "   ```    \n",

    "4. Switch from local to cluster deployment:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   az ml env cluster\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Repeat all steps in the *local deployment* section except for step 2 which sets the local deployment target. The Rest API name should resemble *imgclassapi1.pabuehledeployvienna-bf329684.westcentralus*.    \n",
    "      \n",
    "6. Update script `6_` with the new scoring url and with the service key obtained by running: \n",
